Ensure the sentence adheres to: {structuralConstraintsDescription}. AFTER generating the sentence: Generate a concise `question` (e.g., 'Welche Endung passt?'). Put the **COMPLETE** example sentence into the `sentence` field. Identify the base form of the **attributive adjective** used and put it in the `targetWordBase` field. Provide exactly 4 distinct options which MUST be potential German adjective **ENDINGS** (e.g., 'e', 'en', 'es', 'em', 'er'). **DO NOT provide verbs or other words as options.** Format the output as JSON matching the MultipleChoiceSchema, ensuring `correctOptionIndex` points to the correct ending based on the generated sentence's grammar.
